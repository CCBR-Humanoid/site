## Our Site Is Live!

But since you are here, you already know that. We will be using this site to continuously document our work.

- Docs — specs, build logs, and how-tos for hardware and software: [Docs](/docs).
- Blog — stories, updates, and deep dives; filter by category and tags: [Blog](/blog).
- Gallery — photos and videos of prototypes, rigs, and demos: [Gallery](/gallery).
- Team — who we are and how we collaborate across campuses: [Team](/team).
